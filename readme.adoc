= Code-Architecture-Tests
The idea behind this little sample-project is to test "free" tools for testing the architecture of the written code.

Given that the code should have this structure

TODO: DIAGRAM

the tests should fail if there is any violation against the ruleset.

Tools to check:
* Degraph[http://schauder.github.io/degraph/] (Done)
* JDepend[http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html]
* JDepend + Google Architecture Rules[http://architecturerules.googlecode.com/svn-history/r303/docs/alternatives.html]
* XRadar[http://xradar.sourceforge.net/]
