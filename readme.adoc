the tests should fail if there is any violation against the ruleset.

Tools to check:

* Degraph [http://schauder.github.io/degraph/] (Done)
* JqAssistant http://jqassistant.org/ (Done)
* Macker [https://innig.net/macker/]
* XRadar [http://xradar.sourceforge.net/]
* Architexa [http://www.architexa.com]
* JDepend + Google Architecture Rules [http://architecturerules.googlecode.com/svn-history/r303/docs/alternatives.html] (kicked out - because itÂ´s old and complicated)

== Notes
= JqAssistant
.Commands:
* mvn install to analyze system
* mvn jqassistant:server to start a neo4j-instance on http://localhost:7474/browser/
* mvn jqassistant:report to create a html-report from the generated html (created in folder /target/site/)
